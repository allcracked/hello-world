# hello-world
This is my first repository in Github and im gonna use it just for testing purposes.

I will try to add these new features:
<ol>
  <li>The project must do something</li>
  <li>The project needs to show something</li>
</ol>


I'm adding more information to my readme now, but i'm keeping them in another branch, for now.
